## 4. How The Chain Works

### 4.1 Invitation System
The Chain is an **invite-only social network**. Users generate time-limited "tickets" (invitations) to invite others. Each ticket:
- Has a unique code and QR code
- Expires after a set duration (6-72 hours)
- Can only be claimed once
- Creates a parent-child relationship in the chain

### 4.2 Ticket Rules
- You have a limited number of ticket generation attempts (default: 3)
- If a ticket expires unused, it counts as "wasted"
- After exhausting all attempts, you cannot generate new tickets
- Tickets cannot be transferred, sold, or commercialized

### 4.3 Chain Integrity
Your position in the chain is permanent and immutable. Deleting your account will anonymize your data but preserve your position as "Deleted User" to maintain chain integrity for other users.
