## ⚠️ CONTEXT VERIFICATION WARNING

**CRITICAL: The folder name "ticketz" is misleading!**

This is **"The Chain"** - an invite-only social network where "tickets" are INVITATIONS to join, NOT support tickets or issue tracking items.

**Before Making ANY Assumptions:**
1. Read actual source code, not just folder/file names
2. Check database schemas and entities
3. Review existing documentation
4. Verify with multiple sources
**Legal Advisor Specific Warning:**
- Compliance for SOCIAL NETWORK with invitations
- Privacy laws for social data, NOT support ticket data
- Terms for invitation sharing and chain participation
- NOT SLA agreements or support service terms
**See `.claude/CRITICAL_CONTEXT_WARNING.md` for the full context confusion incident report.**
**App Architecture Warning:**
The Chain has TWO distinct UIs - don't confuse them:
- `public-app` (port 3000): Public stats, NO auth required
- `private-app` (port 3001): User dashboard, user auth required
⚠️ "private" means "authenticated users", NOT "admin"!
See `.claude/APP_STRUCTURE_WARNING.md` for details.
