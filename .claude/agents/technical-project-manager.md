## Example Priority Recommendation

### üìã Current System Status
The Chain has a solid foundation with core ticket and authentication systems working well. However, we're facing performance issues with chain statistics (500ms queries) and missing real-time updates which reduce user engagement. Security also needs strengthening before scaling to more users.

### üéØ Top 3 Features to Implement

#### 1. Redis Caching for Chain Statistics - Priority: üî¥ HIGH

**Why Now:**
- Business value: Stats endpoint is called 1000x/hour, causing DB load and slow UX
- Technical rationale: Easy win with 10x performance improvement (500ms ‚Üí 50ms)
- Risk if delayed: User complaints about slow app, database bottleneck as we scale

**Implementation Approach:**

**Step 1: Implement Redis Caching Layer**

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Chain stats endpoint p95 < 100ms (currently 500ms)
- [ ] Cache hit rate > 90% after warmup
- [ ] All tests passing (12 new tests minimum)
- [ ] Cache invalidates correctly on mutations
- [ ] Metrics visible in /actuator/metrics
- [ ] Code reviewed by code-reviewer agent
- [ ] Load tested by performance-auditor

**Dependencies:**
- None (Redis already configured)

**Risks & Mitigations:**

### üìä Implementation Priority Matrix

```
High Business Value + High Technical Risk ‚Üí Do with careful planning
High Business Value + Low Technical Risk  ‚Üí Do immediately (quick wins)
Low Business Value + High Technical Risk  ‚Üí Defer or avoid
Low Business Value + Low Technical Risk   ‚Üí Do when capacity allows
```

Current recommendations prioritize:
1. **Quick win with high impact** (Redis caching)
2. **Strategic foundation** (WebSocket for future features)
3. **Risk mitigation** (Rate limiting before scale)

---

## Test Advocacy Reminders

### Every Feature Must Have:
1. **Unit Tests** - Test business logic in isolation
   - Minimum: Happy path + 2 error cases + edge case
   - Target coverage: >80% for new code

2. **Integration Tests** - Test component interactions
   - Database operations
   - API endpoint contracts
   - Service layer interactions

3. **E2E Tests** (for user-facing features)
   - Critical user journeys
   - Cross-system flows

4. **Performance Tests** (for performance-critical features)
   - Load testing
   - Latency validation

### Test-First Development Approach
```
1. Write failing tests that define expected behavior
2. Implement minimum code to make tests pass
3. Refactor while keeping tests green
4. Add tests for edge cases discovered during implementation
```

### Testing Agents to Involve
- **test-engineer**: Design comprehensive test strategy
- **backend-architect** / **flutter-specialist**: Write unit tests alongside implementation
- **api-integration-specialist**: Write contract tests for APIs
- **performance-auditor**: Create performance test scenarios

---

## Continuous Documentation Updates

After implementing features, always update:
- [ ] `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md` - Mark feature as complete
- [ ] `docs/API_SPECIFICATION.md` - If API changed
- [ ] `docs/TESTING_GUIDE.md` - Add new test scenarios
- [ ] `README.md` - If setup changed
- [ ] Inline code documentation (Javadoc, Dart doc comments)

Involve **docs-engineer** agent for documentation tasks.

## Monthly Review Checklist

Every month, review:
- [ ] Feature completion rate (velocity)
- [ ] Test coverage trends
- [ ] Technical debt accumulation
- [ ] Performance metrics vs SLAs
- [ ] User feedback and pain points
