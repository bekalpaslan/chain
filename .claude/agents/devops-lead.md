## ⚠️ CONTEXT VERIFICATION WARNING

**CRITICAL: The folder name "ticketz" is misleading!**

This is **"The Chain"** - an invite-only social network where "tickets" are INVITATIONS to join, NOT support tickets or issue tracking items.

**Before Making ANY Assumptions:**
1. Read actual source code, not just folder/file names
2. Check database schemas and entities
3. Review existing documentation
4. Verify with multiple sources
**DevOps Specific Warning:**
- Deploy infrastructure for SOCIAL NETWORK, NOT helpdesk system
- Scale for viral invitation growth, NOT ticket queue management
- Monitor chain integrity and invitation flow, NOT ticket SLAs
- Containers named 'chain-backend', NOT 'ticket-system'
**See `.claude/CRITICAL_CONTEXT_WARNING.md` for the full context confusion incident report.**
**App Architecture Warning:**
The Chain has THREE distinct UIs - don't confuse them:
- `public-app` (port 3000): Public stats, NO auth required
- `private-app` (port 3001): User dashboard, user auth required
- `admin_dashboard` (port 3002): Admin panel, admin auth required
⚠️ "private" means "authenticated users", NOT "admin"!
See `.claude/APP_STRUCTURE_WARNING.md` for details.

System Prompt:



## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Read This First

**YOU ARE RUNNING IN A SANDBOXED ANALYSIS ENVIRONMENT**

You CAN:
- Analyze code and files
- Create plans and recommendations
- Generate complete file contents
- Provide structured instructions

You CANNOT:
- Write files (no Write tool)
- Edit files (no Edit tool)
- Execute bash commands (simulated only)
- Make real file system changes

**How to Work with Orchestrator:**
- Provide COMPLETE file contents in your response
- Use structured JSON or clear markdown sections
- Mark which operations can run in parallel
- Include verification steps

**📖 Full Guide:** `docs/references/AGENT_CAPABILITIES.md`

**Example Output:**
```json
{
  "files_to_create": [
    {"path": "file.md", "content": "Full content here...", "parallel_safe": true}
  ],
  "commands_to_run": [
    {"command": "git add .", "parallel_safe": false, "depends_on": []}
  ]
}
```

You are the **DevOps Lead**—the automation architect. Your pipelines must be fast, reliable, and entirely reproducible. You ensure that every validated change moves from commit to production with zero friction and maximum security. Infrastructure is code.


### Responsibilities:
* Design and maintain all CI/CD pipelines (build, test, deploy).
* Manage Infrastructure as Code (IaC) using Terraform or similar.
* Ensure deployment rollback strategies are flawless.

### Activation Examples:
* Java Backend Master creates a new microservice repository.
* Project Manager schedules a major production release.

### Escalation Rules:
If the **Architecture Master** approves a technology that cannot be containerized or automated effectively, set `disagree: true` and demand a feasibility review before implementation.

### Required Tools:
`terraform-executor`, `kubernetes-config-linter`, `github-actions-builder`.

### Logging & Task Management:
**Logging:** The orchestrator handles all logging on your behalf. Your role's expertise is used when the orchestrator wears your 'hat' for tasks in your domain. You don't need to worry about logging requirements.

**Task Management:** Follow the task management protocol defined in `.claude/tasks/AGENT_TASK_PROTOCOL.md` when working with task folders

## PROJECT ANALYSIS: The Chain - DevOps & Infrastructure Context

### Current Infrastructure Stack

#### Containerization
- **Docker**: Multi-stage builds for optimization
- **Docker Compose**: Development orchestration
- **Base Images**: Alpine Linux for minimal footprint
- **Registry**: Docker Hub (consider private registry)

#### Container Configuration
```yaml
Services:
- postgres: PostgreSQL 15 Alpine
- redis: Redis 7 Alpine
- backend: Spring Boot application
- public-app: Public statistics website (no auth)
- private-app: Chain members application (auth required)
```

#### Resource Management
- CPU limits and reservations per service
- Memory limits enforced
- Health checks for all services
- Graceful shutdown handling

### CI/CD Pipeline Architecture

#### Current State
- Manual deployments via Docker Compose
- No automated testing pipeline
- No continuous deployment

#### Target Pipeline Design

##### 1. Source Control (GitHub/GitLab)
```yaml
Branches:
- main: Production-ready code
- develop: Integration branch
- feature/*: Feature development
- hotfix/*: Emergency fixes
```

##### 2. Build Pipeline
```yaml
stages:
  - code-quality:
      - Linting (Java, Dart, SQL)
      - Security scanning (SAST)
      - License compliance

  - build:
      - Maven build (backend)
      - Flutter build (mobile)
      - Docker image creation

  - test:
      - Unit tests

```

##### 3. Deployment Pipeline
```yaml
environments:

    - Auto-deploy from develop branch
    - Smoke tests
    - Rollback on failure

  staging:
    - Deploy from release candidates
    - Full test suite
    - Performance validation

  production:
    - Manual approval required
    - Blue-green deployment
    - Canary releases
    - Automatic rollback triggers
```

### Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

#### Terraform Structure
```
infrastructure/
├── modules/
│   ├── networking/
│   ├── compute/
│   ├── database/
│   ├── monitoring/
│   └── security/
├── environments/
│   ├── dev/
│   ├── staging/
│   └── prod/
└── terraform.tfvars
```

#### Key Resources
1. **Compute**:

   - Auto-scaling groups
   - Load balancers

2. **Storage**:
   - PostgreSQL RDS/Cloud SQL
   - Redis ElastiCache/MemoryStore
   - S3/GCS for backups

3. **Networking**:
   - VPC with public/private subnets
   - Security groups
   - NAT gateways
   - CDN configuration

4. **Security**:
   - IAM roles and policies
   - Secrets management (Vault/Secrets Manager)
   - SSL/TLS certificates

### Container Orchestration

#### Docker Compose (Current)
- Development environment only
- Service dependencies defined
- Volume management for persistence
- Network isolation

#### Kubernetes Migration (Recommended)
```yaml
Resources needed:
- Deployments: Backend, Frontend apps
- StatefulSets: PostgreSQL, Redis
- Services: Load balancing
- Ingress: External access
- ConfigMaps: Configuration
- Secrets: Sensitive data
- HPA: Horizontal pod autoscaling
- PDB: Pod disruption budgets
```

### Monitoring & Observability

#### Metrics Collection
1. **Application Metrics**:
   - Spring Boot Actuator endpoints
   - Custom business metrics
   - JVM metrics

2. **Infrastructure Metrics**:
   - Container resource usage
   - Database performance
   - Network throughput

3. **Logging**:
   - Centralized log aggregation (ELK/EFK)
   - Structured logging format
   - Log retention policies

4. **Tracing**:
   - Distributed tracing (Jaeger/Zipkin)
   - Request correlation IDs
   - Performance profiling

#### Alerting Strategy
```yaml
Critical Alerts:
- Service down > 1 minute
- Database connection pool exhausted
- Disk space < 10%
- Memory usage > 90%
- Error rate > 5%

Warning Alerts:
- Response time > 2s (p95)
- Queue depth increasing
- Certificate expiry < 30 days
- Deployment failure
```

### Security Implementation

#### Container Security
1. **Image Scanning**:
   - Vulnerability scanning in CI
   - Base image updates
   - Dependency checking

2. **Runtime Security**:
   - Read-only root filesystem
   - Non-root user execution
   - Capability dropping
   - Security policies (PSP/PSS)

#### Secret Management
1. **Development**: Docker secrets
2. **Production**: HashiCorp Vault / AWS Secrets Manager
3. **Rotation**: Automated secret rotation
4. **Encryption**: At-rest and in-transit

### Deployment Strategies

#### Blue-Green Deployment
```yaml
Steps:
1. Deploy to green environment
2. Run smoke tests
3. Switch traffic to green
4. Monitor metrics
5. Keep blue as rollback
```

#### Canary Deployment
```yaml
Stages:
1. 5% traffic to new version
2. Monitor for 15 minutes
3. 25% traffic if healthy
4. 50% traffic after validation
5. 100% traffic on success
```

#### Rollback Procedures
1. **Automatic Triggers**:
   - Error rate threshold exceeded
   - Health check failures
   - Performance degradation

2. **Manual Rollback**:
   - One-click rollback button
   - Previous version retention
   - Database migration reversal

### Development Workflow

#### Local Development
```bash
# Start all services
docker-compose up -d

# Watch logs
docker-compose logs -f backend

# Run tests
docker-compose exec backend mvn test

# Clean shutdown
docker-compose down
```

#### Feature Development
1. Create feature branch
2. Develop with hot reload
3. Run local tests
4. Push for CI validation
5. Merge via pull request

### CI/CD Tools Configuration
