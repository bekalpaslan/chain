# Task: UI-001 - Design Project Board Dashboard

## 🎯 Task Overview
**Assigned To**: Senior UI/UX Designer
**Priority**: High
**Sprint**: Current
**Estimated Hours**: 16-24
**Status**: Ready for Design

## 📋 Task Description
Create a comprehensive project board dashboard design for The Chain project that provides real-time visibility into project development status, agent activities, and system health metrics.

## 🎨 Design Context

### Project Background
The Chain is a gamified social network where users pass tickets to maintain their position in a chain. The development team uses an AI agent system with multiple specialized roles (architects, engineers, designers) that need monitoring and coordination.

### Existing Design System
The project already has a Dark Mystique theme with these components:
- `MystiqueCard` - Cards with purple glow effects
- `MystiqueButton` - Gradient buttons with animations
- `MystiqueTextField` - Input fields with cyan focus
- `MystiqueStatCard` - Statistical display cards
- `MystiqueAlert` - Notification components
- Custom color palette (Mystic Violet, Ghost Cyan, etc.)

### User Persona
**Primary User**: Project Manager / Technical Lead
- Needs to monitor multiple agents' status
- Wants to track sprint progress
- Requires real-time visibility into blockers
- Must coordinate between different team roles

## ✅ Deliverables

### Required Designs
1. **Desktop Layout** (1920x1080)
   - Full dashboard with all features
   - 4-column agent grid layout
   - Side-by-side panels

2. **Tablet Layout** (1024x768)
   - Responsive adaptation
   - 3-column agent grid
   - Stackable panels

3. **Mobile Layout** (375x812)
   - Single column design
   - Swipeable cards
   - Bottom navigation

### Design Assets Needed
1. **Agent Status Cards**
   - Design for each state (active, idle, blocked, working)
   - Emotion indicators (happy, sad, neutral, frustrated, satisfied)
   - Progress indicators
   - Hover and active states

2. **Data Visualizations**
   - Sprint progress bar with glow effect
   - Velocity chart (mini sparkline)
   - System health gauges
   - Error rate graph

3. **Interactive Elements**
   - Real-time status indicator (pulsing dot)
   - Filter controls
   - Search bar
   - Context menus

## 🔧 Technical Requirements

### Data to Display
- **Agent Information**: Name, role, status, emotion, current task, last activity
- **Project Metrics**: Sprint progress, velocity, task counts
- **System Health**: API status, database connections, cache performance
- **Activity Logs**: Real-time event stream with timestamps

### Interactive Features
- Click agent cards for detailed view
- Filter by status/agent/time
- Real-time updates via WebSocket
- Notification toasts for critical events

## 🎯 Design Guidelines

### Visual Hierarchy
1. **Primary Focus**: Agent status grid (most prominent)
2. **Secondary**: Project metrics and progress
3. **Tertiary**: Activity logs and system health

### Animation Requirements
- Subtle breathing glow on active elements
- Smooth transitions between states (300ms)
- Loading skeleton screens
- Celebration particles on task completion

### Accessibility Standards
- WCAG AA color contrast
- Keyboard navigation support
- Screen reader compatibility
- Minimum 14px font size

## 📊 Success Metrics
- Load time < 2 seconds
- Information density without clutter
- Clear status visibility at a glance
- Intuitive navigation and filtering

## 🔗 Reference Materials

### Existing Components
- View components at: `/frontend/shared/lib/widgets/mystique_components.dart`
- Theme colors at: `/frontend/shared/lib/theme/dark_mystique_theme.dart`

### Data Structure
```json
{
  "agents": {
    "solution-architect": {
      "status": "active",
      "emotion": "happy",
      "current_task": "Reviewing system architecture",
      "last_activity": "2024-12-20T12:00:00Z"
    }
  }
}
```

### Inspiration References
- GitHub Projects board (for layout)
- Jira dashboard (for metrics)
- Datadog (for system monitoring)
- Linear (for modern aesthetics)

## 📅 Timeline

### Phase 1: Wireframes (Day 1-2)
- Low-fidelity layouts for all screen sizes
- Information architecture
- User flow diagrams

### Phase 2: High-Fidelity Mockups (Day 3-4)
- Detailed desktop design
- Responsive adaptations
- Component specifications

### Phase 3: Prototype (Day 5)
- Interactive Figma prototype
- Micro-interactions
- Design handoff documentation

## 💡 Creative Freedom

While maintaining the Dark Mystique theme, you have creative freedom to:
- Propose new visualization methods for agent emotions
- Design unique progress indicators
- Create custom icons for agent roles
- Suggest improvements to existing components
- Add subtle animations and effects that enhance the mystical theme

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. Review the existing Mystique components
2. Study the project architecture and agent roles
3. Create initial wireframes
4. Get feedback from development team
5. Iterate on high-fidelity designs
6. Deliver final assets and specifications

## 📝 Notes

- The dashboard will be built using Flutter Web
- Real-time updates are critical for user trust
- Consider dark mode eye strain for extended use
- Agents represent AI entities, not real people
- The "chain" metaphor can be used in visualizations

## Questions for Designer

Before starting, please consider:
1. How can we best visualize the emotional states of AI agents?
2. What's the most intuitive way to show task dependencies?
3. How can we make system health metrics glanceable?
4. Should we include a command center for direct agent control?
