# TASK-003: Initialize CI/CD Pipeline

## Overview
Set up automated CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions to handle builds, tests, and deployments for the Ticketz application.

## Context
Automated CI/CD is essential for:
- Fast feedback on code changes
- Consistent build and test execution
- Automated deployment to staging/production
- Quality gates before merging
- Reduced manual deployment errors

## Technical Approach
The pipeline will include:

### CI (Continuous Integration)
- **Build Stage**: Compile backend (Maven/Gradle), bundle frontend
- **Test Stage**: Run unit tests, integration tests, code coverage
- **Quality Stage**: Linting, static analysis, security scanning
- **Artifact Stage**: Build Docker images, upload artifacts

### CD (Continuous Deployment)
- **Staging Deploy**: Automatic deployment to staging on main branch
- **Production Deploy**: Manual approval gate for production
- **Rollback**: Automated rollback on health check failure

### Technology Stack
- GitHub Actions for workflow orchestration
- Docker for containerization
- Docker Compose for multi-container setup
- GitHub Container Registry for image storage

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Build pipeline configured for backend and frontend
- [ ] Test automation integrated (unit + integration)
- [ ] Deployment stages defined (dev, staging, production)
- [ ] Environment variables secured using GitHub Secrets
- [ ] Documentation complete with workflow diagrams

## Dependencies
- **Depends on**: None
- **Blocks**: None (parallel track)

## Resources
- GitHub Actions docs: https://docs.github.com/en/actions
- Docker best practices: https://docs.docker.com/develop/dev-best-practices/
- Security scanning: Snyk, Trivy

## Testing Strategy
- Test the pipeline itself with sample commits
- Verify all stages execute correctly
- Test rollback procedures
- Validate secret management

## Rollback Plan
If pipeline fails, revert to manual builds and deployments while debugging. Keep manual deployment scripts as backup.

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Code reviewed and approved
- [ ] Tests written and passing (pipeline tests)
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Pipeline successfully deploys to staging
- [ ] Team trained on workflow
- [ ] Runbook created for troubleshooting

## Notes
Consider adding:
- Automated dependency updates (Dependabot)
- Performance regression testing
- Visual regression testing for frontend
- Notification integrations (Slack, email)
