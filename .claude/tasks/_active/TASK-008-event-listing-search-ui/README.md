# TASK-008: Event Listing and Search UI

## Overview
Implement comprehensive event browsing, filtering, and search functionality with grid/list views, category filters, date ranges, and pagination.

## Context
Event discovery is a core feature of the application. Users need to:
- Browse all available events
- Filter by categories, dates, location
- Search by keywords
- Switch between grid and list views
- Navigate through paginated results

## Technical Approach
### Components
1. **EventList/EventGrid**:
   - Responsive grid layout
   - List view alternative
   - Loading states
   - Empty states

2. **EventCard**:
   - Event image
   - Title, date, location
   - Price and availability
   - Quick actions (favorite, share)

3. **SearchBar**:
   - Debounced text input
   - Search suggestions
   - Recent searches

4. **FilterPanel**:
   - Category checkboxes
   - Date range picker
   - Price range slider
   - Location filter
   - Clear filters button

5. **Pagination**:
   - Page navigation
   - Results per page selector
   - Total count display

### State Management
- Event list state
- Filter state
- Search query state
- Pagination state
- Loading and error states

### API Integration
- GET /api/events with query parameters
- Debounced search requests
- Optimistic UI updates
- Cache management

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Event grid view with responsive layout
- [ ] List view toggle with smooth transition
- [ ] Category filtering with multi-select
- [ ] Date range selection with calendar
- [ ] Text search with debouncing
- [ ] Pagination with page size options

## Dependencies
- **Depends on**: TASK-002 (Frontend Development Kickoff), TASK-006 (Authentication UI)
- **Blocks**: None

## Resources
- Backend events API: `/api/events`
- Design mockups: TBD
- Event data schema: TBD

## Testing Strategy
- Unit tests: Component logic, filter functions, search debouncing
- Integration tests: API integration, state management
- E2E tests: Browse, filter, search flows
- Performance tests: Load time, render performance

## Rollback Plan
If there are critical issues, fall back to simple list view without advanced filtering.

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Code reviewed and approved
- [ ] Tests written and passing (>80% coverage)
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Performance targets met
- [ ] Deployed to staging
- [ ] UX review completed

## Notes
Consider adding:
- Save search functionality
- Email alerts for new events
- Event recommendations
- Map view of events
- Social sharing
