# TASK-007: Database Migration Strategy

## Overview
Implement version-controlled database migrations using Flyway or Liquibase to manage schema changes safely and consistently across environments.

## Context
Database migrations are critical for:
- Tracking schema changes over time
- Consistent deployments across environments
- Safe rollback capabilities
- Team collaboration on schema changes
- Automated deployment pipelines

## Technical Approach
### Tool Selection
Compare Flyway vs Liquibase:
- **Flyway**: Simpler, SQL-based, good for straightforward migrations
- **Liquibase**: More powerful, XML/YAML/JSON support, better for complex scenarios

Recommendation: Start with Flyway for simplicity.

### Migration Strategy
1. **Baseline**: Create initial migration from current schema
2. **Versioning**: Use timestamp-based versioning (V{timestamp}__)
3. **Naming**: Descriptive names (V20250110__create_users_table.sql)
4. **Organization**: Separate folders for DDL, DML, stored procedures

### Rollback Strategy
- Maintain reverse migrations (undo scripts)
- Test rollbacks in staging
- Document manual rollback procedures
- Keep database backups before migrations

### CI/CD Integration
- Validate migrations in CI
- Auto-apply in dev/staging
- Manual approval for production
- Health checks after migration

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Migration tool selected (Flyway/Liquibase)
- [ ] Initial baseline migration created
- [ ] Rollback strategy defined and documented
- [ ] Documentation complete with examples
- [ ] CI/CD integration configured

## Dependencies
- **Depends on**: None
- **Blocks**: None

## Resources
- Flyway: https://flywaydb.org/
- Liquibase: https://www.liquibase.org/
- Migration best practices: https://www.liquibase.com/resources/guides/database-migrations-best-practices

## Testing Strategy
- Test migrations on clean database
- Test rollback procedures
- Verify idempotency
- Test with production-like data volume

## Rollback Plan
If migration tool causes issues, temporarily manage schema changes manually while investigating. Keep schema creation scripts as backup.

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Code reviewed and approved
- [ ] Migrations tested on all environments
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Team trained on migration process
- [ ] Runbook created for production migrations

## Notes
Best practices:
- Never modify applied migrations
- Always test migrations with realistic data
- Keep migrations small and focused
- Include both up and down migrations
- Use transactions when possible
