## 2025-01-10 12:00 - Task Created
**Agent:** claude-code
**Status:** none → pending
**Emotion:** focused

Task created and assigned to senior-mobile-developer.

### Task Overview
- **ID:** TASK-011
- **Title:** Implement Task Management UI in Admin Portal
- **Type:** feature
- **Priority:** HIGH
- **Story Points:** 8
- **Due Date:** 2025-01-17T18:00:00Z

### Scope
Create a comprehensive Flutter-based Task Management UI for the admin portal that provides real-time visibility into the backend folder-based task system, including:
- Task list view with filtering, sorting, and search
- Kanban board with drag-and-drop status changes
- Detailed task view with tabs (Overview, Progress, Deliverables, Logs)
- Analytics dashboard with charts and metrics
- Real-time WebSocket updates for task changes
- Task creation and editing capabilities

### Documentation Created
- ✅ Comprehensive README.md (2,028 lines) with complete implementation guide
- ✅ Data models specified using Freezed (Task, TaskProgress, ProgressEntry, TaskMetrics, TaskTrend)
- ✅ Riverpod state management architecture documented
- ✅ All UI components detailed with Flutter/Dart code examples
- ✅ API service layer with WebSocket support specified
- ✅ Testing strategy defined with unit, widget, and integration test examples
- ✅ Acceptance criteria defined (10 detailed criteria)
- ✅ Performance targets specified (<500ms rendering, 60fps animations)

### Dependencies
- **Depends on:** TASK-009 (Backend Task Management API must provide REST and WebSocket endpoints)

### Next Steps for Senior Mobile Developer
1. Review comprehensive README.md in task folder
2. Set up Flutter project dependencies (Riverpod, Freezed, Dio, fl_chart, WebSocket)
3. Generate Freezed models and providers using build_runner
4. Implement data models and state management layer
5. Create UI components starting with Task Dashboard Screen
6. Integrate with backend API (coordinate with backend team)
7. Implement WebSocket real-time updates
8. Add charts and analytics visualizations
9. Write unit and widget tests
10. Conduct performance testing

Task is ready for implementation. Senior-mobile-developer should start by reviewing the README.md and then updating this progress log when beginning work.

## 2025-01-10 12:30 - Task Started
**Agent:** senior-mobile-developer
**Status:** pending → in_progress
**Emotion:** focused

Beginning implementation of Task Management UI for admin portal.

### Initial Assessment
Reviewed comprehensive README.md (2,028 lines) with complete implementation guide. The specification is clear and detailed with:
- Complete data models using Freezed
- Riverpod state management architecture
- All UI components with Flutter code examples
- API service layer with WebSocket support
- Testing strategy and acceptance criteria

### Implementation Plan
Will implement in phases:
1. **Phase 1:** Set up project structure and dependencies
2. **Phase 2:** Create data models and generate code
3. **Phase 3:** Implement state management with Riverpod providers
4. **Phase 4:** Build UI components (Dashboard, List, Board, Details, Analytics)
5. **Phase 5:** Integrate real-time WebSocket updates
6. **Phase 6:** Add charts and analytics
7. **Phase 7:** Write tests and optimize performance

### Next Immediate Steps
- Set up Flutter project in `frontend/admin_dashboard/`
- Add dependencies to pubspec.yaml
- Create data models using Freezed
- Run build_runner for code generation

Starting with Phase 1...

## 2025-01-10 12:33 - Phase 2 Complete: Data Models Generated
**Agent:** senior-mobile-developer
**Status:** in_progress
**Emotion:** happy

Successfully completed Phase 2 - Data model creation and code generation.

### Completed Actions
- ✅ Updated `pubspec.yaml` with all required dependencies (Riverpod, Freezed, Dio, FL Chart)
- ✅ Installed dependencies with `flutter pub get`
- ✅ Created `lib/models/task.dart` with Freezed annotations
- ✅ Ran code generation: `flutter pub run build_runner build`
- ✅ Generated files: `task.freezed.dart` (35.5KB) and `task.g.dart` (4.3KB)

### Data Models Implemented
**Task Model:**
- Complete task entity with all metadata fields
- Support for optional fields (assignedAgent, tags, metadata, progress)
- DateTime tracking (createdAt, updatedAt, startedAt, completedAt)

**TaskProgress Model:**
- Percentage tracking
- Current phase indicator
- List of progress entries with history

**ProgressEntry Model:**
- Timestamp-based logging
- Phase and percentage per entry
- Optional notes and agent attribution

**Enums:**
- TaskStatus: inbox, active, completed, archived
- TaskPriority: low, medium, high, critical

### Code Generation Output
```
[INFO] Succeeded after 15.4s with 53 outputs (140 actions)
```

All models now have:
- Immutable classes with `freezed`
- JSON serialization support
- Type-safe copyWith methods
- Automatic equality and hashCode
- toString implementations

### Next Steps - Phase 3
- Create TaskMetrics and TaskTrend models
- Implement Riverpod providers for state management
- Set up API service layer with Dio
- Create WebSocket service for real-time updates

Moving to Phase 3: State Management...
