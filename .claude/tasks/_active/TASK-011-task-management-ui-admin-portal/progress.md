## 2025-01-10 12:00 - Task Created
**Agent:** claude-code
**Status:** none → pending
**Emotion:** focused

Task created and assigned to senior-mobile-developer.

### Task Overview
- **ID:** TASK-011
- **Title:** Implement Task Management UI in Admin Portal
- **Type:** feature
- **Priority:** HIGH
- **Story Points:** 8
- **Due Date:** 2025-01-17T18:00:00Z

### Scope
Create a comprehensive Flutter-based Task Management UI for the admin portal that provides real-time visibility into the backend folder-based task system, including:
- Task list view with filtering, sorting, and search
- Kanban board with drag-and-drop status changes
- Detailed task view with tabs (Overview, Progress, Deliverables, Logs)
- Analytics dashboard with charts and metrics
- Real-time WebSocket updates for task changes
- Task creation and editing capabilities

### Documentation Created
- ✅ Comprehensive README.md (2,028 lines) with complete implementation guide
- ✅ Data models specified using Freezed (Task, TaskProgress, ProgressEntry, TaskMetrics, TaskTrend)
- ✅ Riverpod state management architecture documented
- ✅ All UI components detailed with Flutter/Dart code examples
- ✅ API service layer with WebSocket support specified
- ✅ Testing strategy defined with unit, widget, and integration test examples
- ✅ Acceptance criteria defined (10 detailed criteria)
- ✅ Performance targets specified (<500ms rendering, 60fps animations)

### Dependencies
- **Depends on:** TASK-009 (Backend Task Management API must provide REST and WebSocket endpoints)

### Next Steps for Senior Mobile Developer
1. Review comprehensive README.md in task folder
2. Set up Flutter project dependencies (Riverpod, Freezed, Dio, fl_chart, WebSocket)
3. Generate Freezed models and providers using build_runner
4. Implement data models and state management layer
5. Create UI components starting with Task Dashboard Screen
6. Integrate with backend API (coordinate with backend team)
7. Implement WebSocket real-time updates
8. Add charts and analytics visualizations
9. Write unit and widget tests
10. Conduct performance testing

Task is ready for implementation. Senior-mobile-developer should start by reviewing the README.md and then updating this progress log when beginning work.

**Agent:** senior-mobile-developer
**Status:** pending → in_progress
**Emotion:** focused

Beginning implementation of Task Management UI for admin portal.

### Initial Assessment
Reviewed comprehensive README.md (2,028 lines) with complete implementation guide. The specification is clear and detailed with:
- Complete data models using Freezed
- Riverpod state management architecture
- All UI components with Flutter code examples
- API service layer with WebSocket support
- Testing strategy and acceptance criteria

### Implementation Plan
Will implement in phases:
1. **Phase 1:** Set up project structure and dependencies
