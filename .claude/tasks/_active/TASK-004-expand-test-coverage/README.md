# TASK-004: Expand Test Coverage

## Overview
Create a comprehensive test plan and expand test coverage to achieve 80% backend coverage with automated reporting.

## Context
Current test coverage is insufficient for production readiness. This task will establish:
- Comprehensive test plan covering all layers
- Unit test coverage of 80%+ for backend
- Integration tests for critical user flows
- Performance baseline for regression detection
- Automated test reporting

## Technical Approach
### Test Pyramid Strategy
1. **Unit Tests (70% of tests)**: Fast, isolated component tests
2. **Integration Tests (20% of tests)**: API endpoints, database interactions
3. **E2E Tests (10% of tests)**: Critical user journeys

### Coverage Areas
- Controllers and REST endpoints
- Service layer business logic
- Repository layer and data access
- Utility functions and helpers
- Authentication and authorization
- Error handling and edge cases

### Tools and Frameworks
- JUnit 5 for unit tests
- Mockito for mocking
- TestContainers for integration tests
- JaCoCo for coverage reporting
- AssertJ for assertions

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Test plan documented with coverage strategy
- [ ] Unit tests achieve 80% coverage
- [ ] Integration tests for critical flows (auth, events, tickets)
- [ ] Performance baseline established
- [ ] Test reports automated in CI/CD

## Dependencies
- **Depends on**: None
- **Blocks**: None

## Resources
- JUnit 5 docs: https://junit.org/junit5/
- TestContainers: https://www.testcontainers.org/
- JaCoCo: https://www.jacoco.org/

## Testing Strategy
Meta-testing considerations:
- Test the test infrastructure itself
- Verify coverage reporting accuracy
- Validate test data generators
- Ensure tests are deterministic

## Rollback Plan
N/A - Adding tests doesn't require rollback

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Code reviewed and approved
- [ ] 80% coverage achieved and verified
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] CI/CD integration complete
- [ ] Team trained on testing practices

## Notes
Focus on meaningful tests, not just coverage numbers. Prioritize testing business logic and critical paths over trivial getters/setters.
