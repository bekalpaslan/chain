This task was migrated from the legacy task tracking system to the new folder-based structure as part of the task management system overhaul.

**Original Source:** UI-001-project-board.md
**Migration Date:** 2025-01-10T10:00:00Z

### Context
This task was originally created as UI-001 for the Senior UI/UX Designer. It defines the design requirements for the project board dashboard that will be implemented by TASK-009.

The design work should establish:
- Visual layouts for desktop, tablet, and mobile
- Agent card designs with emotion indicators
- Data visualization components
- Interactive elements and animations
- Complete Figma prototype

### Current Status
- Task requirements documented
- Design brief complete
- Ready for designer to begin wireframes

### Dependencies
This task blocks TASK-009 (implementation), though development can begin with existing Mystique components while design work progresses in parallel.
