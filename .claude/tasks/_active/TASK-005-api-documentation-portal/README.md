# TASK-005: API Documentation Portal

## Overview
Deploy Swagger UI with comprehensive, interactive API documentation including examples, authentication flows, and getting started guides.

## Context
Good API documentation is critical for:
- Frontend developers integrating with the backend
- External partners or API consumers
- New team members onboarding
- Testing and debugging
- Contract-first development

## Technical Approach
### OpenAPI/Swagger Setup
- SpringDoc OpenAPI for Spring Boot integration
- Swagger UI for interactive documentation
- OpenAPI 3.0 specification

### Documentation Scope
1. **All REST Endpoints**:
   - Authentication endpoints
   - Event management
   - Ticket operations
   - User management
   - Chain mechanics

2. **For Each Endpoint**:
   - Description and purpose
   - Request parameters
   - Request body schema
   - Response codes and schemas
   - Example requests/responses
   - Authentication requirements

3. **Getting Started Guide**:
   - Authentication flow
   - Common use cases
   - Error handling
   - Rate limiting
   - Versioning strategy

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Swagger UI accessible at `/swagger-ui.html`
- [ ] All endpoints documented with descriptions
- [ ] Request/response examples added for all endpoints
- [ ] Getting started guide written
- [ ] Authentication flow documented with examples

## Dependencies
- **Depends on**: None
- **Blocks**: None

## Resources
- SpringDoc: https://springdoc.org/
- OpenAPI Spec: https://spec.openapis.org/oas/v3.0.0
- Swagger UI: https://swagger.io/tools/swagger-ui/

## Testing Strategy
- Verify all endpoints appear in Swagger
- Test "Try it out" functionality
- Validate example requests work
- Check authentication integration

## Rollback Plan
If Swagger causes issues, disable it in configuration. Documentation can fallback to static markdown files.

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Code reviewed and approved
- [ ] Swagger UI tested and verified
- [ ] Getting started guide reviewed
- [ ] Documentation accessible in staging
- [ ] Frontend team validated usability

## Notes
Consider adding:
- API versioning documentation
- Deprecation notices for old endpoints
- SDK/client library examples
- Postman collection export
