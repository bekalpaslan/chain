# TASK-002: Frontend Development Kickoff

## Overview
Design and implement the frontend architecture for the Ticketz application, including framework selection, component structure, and core infrastructure setup.

## Context
This is a foundational task that will establish the entire frontend architecture. The decisions made here will impact all future frontend development. Key considerations include:
- Framework selection (React/Vue/Angular)
- State management approach
- Component architecture
- Build and deployment pipeline
- Development workflow

## Technical Approach
The implementation will follow these steps:
1. **Framework Evaluation**: Compare React, Vue, and Angular based on:
   - Team expertise
   - Performance requirements
   - Ecosystem maturity
   - Long-term maintenance

2. **Architecture Design**:
   - Component hierarchy and organization
   - State management (Redux/Vuex/NgRx vs simpler solutions)
   - Routing strategy
   - Code splitting approach

3. **Core Setup**:
   - Project scaffolding
   - Build configuration (Vite/Webpack)
   - Linting and formatting (ESLint, Prettier)
   - Testing framework (Jest, React Testing Library)

4. **Integration Points**:
   - API client configuration (Axios/Fetch)
   - Authentication flow
   - Error handling
   - Loading states

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Framework selected and justified with documentation
- [ ] Component hierarchy designed and documented
- [ ] Routing structure implemented
- [ ] Authentication flow integrated with backend
- [ ] API client configured with interceptors

## Dependencies
- **Depends on**: None (can start immediately)
- **Blocks**: TASK-006 (Authentication UI Components), TASK-008 (Event Listing and Search UI)

## Resources
- Backend API docs: `/docs/api/`
- Design system: TBD
- Reference implementations: TBD

## Testing Strategy
- Unit tests: Component logic, utilities, API client
- Integration tests: Route navigation, API integration
- E2E tests: Critical user flows (login, event browsing)
- Performance tests: Bundle size, load times, runtime performance

## Rollback Plan
If framework choice proves problematic, document issues and create spike task for migration. Initial setup should be modular enough to allow framework swap if needed.

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Code reviewed and approved
- [ ] Tests written and passing (>80% coverage)
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Deployed to staging
- [ ] QA sign-off received
- [ ] Product owner approval

## Notes
This is a critical path task. All frontend development depends on this foundation. Consider creating a spike task first if framework decision needs more research.
