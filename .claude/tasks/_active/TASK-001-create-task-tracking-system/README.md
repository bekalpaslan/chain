# TASK-001: Create Task Tracking System

## Overview
Establish a formal task management system using the `.claude/tasks/` directory with JSONL format for tracking project work and agent assignments.

## Context
As the project grows, we need a structured way to track tasks, assignments, and progress across multiple agents. This task tracking system will provide:
- Clear visibility into all project tasks
- Formal assignment and ownership tracking
- Integration with the agent system
- Historical record of task progression

## Technical Approach
The system will use:
- **JSONL format** for active tasks (one JSON object per line)
- **Template system** for consistent task creation
- **Directory structure** for organizing tasks by status
- **Agent protocol** for task assignment and updates

Key components:
- `active-tasks.jsonl` - Current tasks in progress or pending
- `TASK_SYSTEM_SPECIFICATION.md` - Documentation of the task system
- `AGENT_TASK_PROTOCOL.md` - Guidelines for agents interacting with tasks
- `TASK_TEMPLATE.json` - Template for new task creation

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Task files created in JSONL format
- [x] Template system established
- [x] Workflow documented
- [ ] Integration with agent system

## Dependencies
- **Depends on**: None
- **Blocks**: TASK-002, TASK-003, TASK-004, TASK-005, TASK-006, TASK-007, TASK-008

## Resources
- Related docs: `.claude/tasks/TASK_SYSTEM_SPECIFICATION.md`
- Reference tickets: N/A
- Design files: N/A
- API specs: N/A

## Testing Strategy
- Unit tests: N/A (infrastructure setup)
- Integration tests: Verify agents can read and update tasks
- E2E tests: Full workflow from task creation to completion
- Performance tests: N/A

## Rollback Plan
If the system doesn't work as expected, revert to ad-hoc task tracking in agent conversations and status files.

## Definition of Done
- [x] All acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Code reviewed and approved
- [ ] Tests written and passing (>80% coverage)
- [x] Documentation updated
- [ ] Deployed to staging
- [ ] QA sign-off received
- [ ] Product owner approval

## Notes
This is the foundation for all future task tracking. It's critical to get the structure right before scaling to more complex workflows.
