## 2025-01-10 10:00 - Task Migrated to New System
**Agent:** system-migration
**Status:** none â†’ in_progress

This task was migrated from the legacy task tracking system to the new folder-based structure as part of the task management system overhaul.

**Original Source:** active-tasks.jsonl line 1
**Migration Date:** 2025-01-10T10:00:00Z

### Context
This task represents the initial work to create the task tracking system itself. It's currently marked as in_progress because the basic JSONL structure was created, but full integration with the agent system and migration to the folder-based structure is still ongoing.

### Current Status
The task has achieved most of its initial goals:
- JSONL format established
- Template system created
- Basic documentation written

Still remaining:
- Full integration with agent system
- Migration to new folder-based structure
- Testing and validation

*Task is ready for the project-manager to continue work on completing the integration.*
