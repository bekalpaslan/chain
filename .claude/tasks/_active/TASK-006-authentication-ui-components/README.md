# TASK-006: Authentication UI Components

## Overview
Create complete authentication UI components including login, registration, password reset, and JWT token management.

## Context
Authentication is the gateway to the application. These components must be:
- Secure (XSS, CSRF protection)
- User-friendly (clear validation, helpful errors)
- Accessible (keyboard navigation, screen readers)
- Responsive (mobile and desktop)

## Technical Approach
### Components to Build
1. **LoginForm**:
   - Email and password fields
   - Remember me checkbox
   - Forgot password link
   - Form validation
   - Error handling

2. **RegistrationForm**:
   - Email, username, password fields
   - Password strength indicator
   - Terms acceptance
   - Email verification flow

3. **PasswordResetForm**:
   - Request reset (email)
   - Reset with token
   - Password confirmation

4. **AuthContext/Hook**:
   - User state management
   - Token storage (httpOnly cookies or localStorage)
   - Auto-refresh tokens
   - Logout functionality

5. **ProtectedRoute**:
   - Route guard component
   - Redirect to login
   - Role-based access

### Security Measures
- Input sanitization
- CSRF token handling
- Secure token storage
- XSS prevention
- Rate limiting integration

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Login form with client-side validation
- [ ] Registration with email verification flow
- [ ] Password reset flow (request + reset)
- [ ] JWT token handling with refresh
- [ ] Protected route implementation with redirects

## Dependencies
- **Depends on**: TASK-002 (Frontend Development Kickoff)
- **Blocks**: TASK-008 (Event Listing and Search UI)

## Resources
- Backend auth API: `/api/auth/*`
- Design mockups: TBD
- Security guidelines: OWASP

## Testing Strategy
- Unit tests: Form validation, token handling
- Integration tests: Full auth flows
- E2E tests: Login, registration, password reset
- Security tests: XSS attempts, CSRF validation

## Rollback Plan
If components have critical issues, temporarily use basic HTML forms while fixing, or revert to previous version.

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Code reviewed and approved
- [ ] Tests written and passing (>80% coverage)
- [ ] Security review completed
- [ ] Accessibility tested
- [ ] Deployed to staging
- [ ] UX review completed

## Notes
Consider adding:
- Social login (Google, Facebook)
- Two-factor authentication
- Biometric authentication
- Password manager integration
