## Recommended Approach for Remaining Updates

For each remaining agent:
1. Update name to industry-standard title
2. Adjust display_name and description
3. Add PROJECT ANALYSIS section with:
   - Relevant technology context
   - Specific responsibilities in The Chain project
   - Key interfaces with other roles
   - Success metrics
   - Development guidelines

## Priority Order
1. **test-master.md** - Critical for quality
2. **project-manager.md** - Coordination essential
3. **legal-software-advisor.md** - Compliance risks
4. **game-theory-master.md** - Core to gamification
5. Others as needed
