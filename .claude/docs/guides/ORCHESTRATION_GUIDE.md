## 🎭 How to Orchestrate Agents

### When You (Primary Agent) Should Delegate

**DO delegate to specialized agents when:**
1. The task requires deep domain expertise (architecture, legal, game theory, etc.)
2. The task is multi-step and autonomous (research, analysis, implementation planning)
3. You need parallel work streams (e.g., backend + frontend + tests simultaneously)
4. The task matches an agent's activation trigger (see table above)

**DO NOT delegate when:**
1. The task is trivial and you can handle it directly
2. The user wants immediate interaction (not background work)
3. The task requires real-time conversation with the user

### Delegation Patterns

#### Pattern 1: Project Kickoff
```
User: "Build a new ticket management feature"
↓
1. Activate project-manager → breaks down into tasks
2. Project-manager activates:
   - architecture-master → designs system structure
   - ui-designer → creates mockups
3. Once design approved:
   - java-backend-master → implements API
   - web-dev-master → implements frontend
   - test-master → writes tests (parallel)
4. ci-cd-master → sets up deployment pipeline
```

#### Pattern 2: Research & Analysis
```
User: "Should we add gamification?"
↓
1. Activate psychologist-game-dynamics → analyzes user motivation
2. Activate opportunist-strategist → researches market trends
3. Activate game-theory-master → models incentive structures
4. You synthesize findings and present to user
```

#### Pattern 3: Conflict Resolution
```
Agent A logs: { "disagree": true, "disagree_reason": "Schema violates normalization" }
↓
1. Activate scrum-master → mediates disagreement
2. If unresolved after 2 cycles → project-manager override
```

#### Pattern 4: High-Risk Changes
```
Agent logs: { "risk_level": "high", "affected_agents": ["web-dev-master", "flutter-dart-master"] }
↓
1. watch-claude.ps1 daemon automatically alerts affected agents
2. Affected agents review and adjust their work
3. No manual coordination needed—system handles it
```

## 📊 The Logging Infrastructure

### Two-Tier System

#### 1. Append-Only History: `.claude/logs/<agent-name>.log`
- **Format**: JSONL (newline-delimited JSON)
- **Purpose**: Immutable audit trail
- **Update**: Always append, never modify

#### 2. Live Snapshot: `.claude/status.json`
- **Format**: Single JSON object (last-writer-wins)
- **Purpose**: Real-time dashboard state
- **Update**: Atomic replace (write to temp → move)

### Critical Log Fields

**Always include in agent logs:**
- `timestamp` (ISO 8601 UTC)
- `agent` (must match agent ID)
- `status` (idle|working|blocked|done)
- `emotion` (happy|sad|frustrated|satisfied|neutral)
- `findings` (human-readable summary)

**Include when task impacts others:**
- `task_id`, `task_title`, `task_description`
- `risk_level` (low|medium|high|critical)
- `affected_agents` (array of agent IDs)
- `potential_consequences` (array of {severity, impact, description, estimated_duration})
- `mitigation` (required when risk_level is high/critical)
- `safe_to_deploy` (boolean)

### Emotion Tracking (CRITICAL)

Agents **must** report emotions to create observable signals:

| Emotion | When to Report |
|---------|----------------|
| **happy** | Milestone completion, breakthrough, successful deployment |
| **sad** | Task >4 iterations OR >4x estimated time, performance issues, failing tests |
| **frustrated** | Blocked by another agent's inactivity or error |
| **satisfied** | Recovery from blocked/sad state to working |
| **neutral** | Default, steady progress |

**Why this matters**: Emotion tracking forces immediate attention to bottlenecks (sadness/frustration) and validates optimal processes (happiness/satisfaction). This is **not cosmetic**—it's a psychological feedback loop that prevents silent failures.

## 🛠️ PowerShell Tools for Agent Logging

### Available Tools in `.claude/tools/`

1. **`update-status.ps1`** (Core Library)
   - `Add-ClaudelogEntry -Agent <name> -Entry <object>` → Append to log
   - `Set-ClaudestatusAtomically -StatusObject <object>` → Update status.json

2. **`claude-log.ps1`** (CLI Wrapper)
   ```powershell
   Get-Content entry.json | .\.claude\tools\claude-log.ps1 -Agent java-backend-master
   Get-Content snapshot.json | .\.claude\tools\claude-log.ps1 -Snapshot
   ```

3. **`watch-claude.ps1`** (Monitoring Daemon)
   - Watches logs for high/critical risk entries
   - Auto-alerts affected agents
   - Runs as background process

4. **`validate-claude.ps1`** (Validation)
   - Checks all logs are valid JSON
   - Enforces semantic rules (e.g., high risk must have mitigation)
   - Run before commits

## 🎯 The Workflow & Escalation Paths

### Standard Flow
```
User Request
    ↓
Primary Agent (you) OR Project Manager
    ↓
Task Breakdown & Assignment
    ↓
Specialized Agents Execute
    ↓
    ├─→ Success → Log happy → Next task
    ├─→ Blocked → Log blocked:true → Scrum Master mediates
    ├─→ Disagree → Log disagree:true → Scrum Master mediates
    └─→ High Risk → Log with affected_agents → Auto-alert via watch daemon
```

### Escalation Rules

1. **Agent Blocked**: Scrum Master mediates → if unresolved after 2 cycles → Project Manager overrides
2. **Critical Opportunity**: Opportunist-Strategist bypasses PM → goes directly to Architecture Master for feasibility
3. **Unauthorized Architectural Change**: Architecture Master escalates to PM with `importance: critical`
4. **Performance Disagreement**: Backend/Database agents set `disagree: true` → Architecture Master arbitrates

---

## 📈 Success Metrics & Goals

### What "Victory" Looks Like

1. **Zero Hesitation**: Specialists act with total confidence in their domain
2. **Auditable Trust**: Every state change, blockage, disagreement is logged (immutable record)
3. **Emotional Resonance**: Immediate attention to bottlenecks, validation of optimal processes
4. **Market Dominance**: Opportunist-Strategist constantly finds gold, team capitalizes fast

### Project-Specific Goals (Ticketz)

- **Core Product**: Enterprise-grade ticket management system
- **Tech Stack**: Java/Spring Boot backend, Flutter mobile, React/Vue web
- **Quality Bar**: 100% test coverage on critical paths, <200ms API latency, WCAG AA accessibility
- **Market Position**: Find and exploit gaps in competitor offerings (Jira, Linear, etc.)

---

## 🚨 Critical Operating Principles

### 1. Specialized Masters, Not Generalists
- Each agent is sovereign in their domain
- Never let agents work outside their expertise
- Example: Don't ask UI Designer to write backend code

### 2. Fast Decisions, Auditable Disagreements
- Decisions must be fast (log immediately)
- Disagreements must be auditable (`disagree: true` with reason)
- Resolution must be immediate (Scrum Master mediation, PM override)

### 3. Emotional Honesty
- Agents must report true emotional state
- "Happy" spam is forbidden—only report happiness for real milestones
- "Sad" is not failure—it's a signal to optimize or pivot

### 4. Cross-Agent Awareness
- High-risk tasks must declare affected_agents
- Watch daemon ensures no agent is surprised by others' changes
- Mitigation plans are mandatory for high/critical risk

### 5. Continuous Market Intelligence
- Opportunist-Strategist runs constantly (background)
- Market opportunities are prioritized by Project Manager
- Legal Advisor gates risky integrations/markets

## 🎬 How to Start Your Session

### Step 1: Read This Document
You're doing it now. Good.

### Step 2: Check Current Agent Status
```bash
# View live status
cat .claude/status.json

# Or use the dashboard
# Open .claude/admin.html in browser
```

### Step 3: Understand the User's Request
- Is it a new feature? → Activate project-manager
- Is it research? → Activate relevant specialists
- Is it a bug? → Activate relevant implementation agents + test-master
- Is it strategic? → Activate opportunist-strategist, game-theory-master

### Step 4: Delegate or Execute
- **Delegate** if it matches agent activation triggers
- **Execute** directly if it's simple and immediate

### Step 5: Update Logs
- If you take agent role, update your log with emotion
- If you delegate, ensure agents update their logs
- Always update status.json after state changes

## 🎯 Remember

You are not just writing code. You are **orchestrating a team of specialized masters** to build something extraordinary. Use the logging system to create transparency, use emotions to surface problems early, use delegation to multiply your effectiveness, and use the escalation paths to prevent deadlocks.

**Velocity. Vision. Victory.**
