## üèóÔ∏è Task 1.6: Build & Deploy

### Step 1: Delete Public App

- [ ] Delete entire `frontend/public-app/` directory
- [ ] Verify it's deleted: `ls frontend/`
- [ ] Update `.gitignore` if needed

### Step 2: Rebuild Flutter App

- [ ] Navigate to private-app: `cd frontend/private-app`
- [ ] Clean previous builds: `flutter clean`
- [ ] Get dependencies: `flutter pub get`
- [ ] Build for web: `flutter build web --release`
- [ ] Verify build succeeded (check for errors)

### Step 3: Rebuild Docker Containers

- [ ] Navigate to root: `cd ../..`
- [ ] Stop all services: `docker-compose down`
- [ ] Rebuild private-app: `docker-compose build private-app`
- [ ] Start all services: `docker-compose up -d`
- [ ] Check status: `docker-compose ps`
- [ ] Verify all services healthy

**Directories deleted:** `frontend/public-app/`
**Containers rebuilt:** `chain-private-app`

## üß™ Task 1.7: Testing

### Test 1: Unauthenticated Access

- [ ] Open browser in incognito/private mode
- [ ] Navigate to http://localhost:3001
- [ ] Dashboard loads without redirect to login
- [ ] See chain statistics
- [ ] See "Join The Chain" CTA button
- [ ] See "Sign In" link
- [ ] NO FAB button visible
- [ ] NO ticket banner visible
- [ ] NO settings icon visible

### Test 2: CTA Navigation

- [ ] Click "Join The Chain" button
- [ ] Should navigate to `/register` (or show coming soon)
- [ ] Go back to dashboard
- [ ] Click "Sign In" link
- [ ] Should navigate to `/login`

### Test 3: Authenticated Access

- [ ] Login with test user: `testuser_50@test.com` / `password123`
  - If password fails, use set-password endpoint (see KNOWN_ISSUES.md)
- [ ] After login, should see full dashboard
- [ ] FAB button visible (bottom-right)
- [ ] Ticket banner visible (if has active ticket)
- [ ] Settings icon visible
- [ ] All features working

### Test 4: FAB Navigation

- [ ] Click FAB button
- [ ] Should navigate to `/ticket`

- [ ] See share buttons
- [ ] Can navigate back to dashboard

### Test 5: Logout & Return

- [ ] Logout (if logout button exists)
- [ ] Should see public dashboard view
- [ ] FAB hidden
- [ ] Ticket banner hidden
- [ ] CTA visible

- [ ] ‚úÖ `docker-compose.yml` has no `public-app` service
- [ ] ‚úÖ http://localhost:3001 loads without authentication
- [ ] ‚úÖ Unauthenticated users see stats + CTA (no FAB)
- [ ] ‚úÖ Authenticated users see full dashboard (with FAB)
- [ ] ‚úÖ "Join The Chain" navigates to registration (or shows coming soon)
- [ ] ‚úÖ "Sign In" navigates to login
- [ ] ‚úÖ Login works correctly
- [ ] ‚úÖ After login, FAB appears
- [ ] ‚úÖ After login, ticket banner appears (if has active ticket)
- [ ] ‚úÖ No console errors in browser
- [ ] ‚úÖ No broken links
- [ ] ‚úÖ All Docker containers running and healthy

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Issue: Password login fails
‚Üí See [KNOWN_ISSUES.md](KNOWN_ISSUES.md) #1 - Use `/set-password` endpoint

### Issue: Flutter build fails
```bash
cd frontend/private-app
flutter clean
flutter pub get
flutter build web --release
```

### Issue: Docker container won't start
```bash
docker-compose down
docker-compose build --no-cache private-app
docker-compose up -d
docker logs chain-private-app -f
```

### Issue: Dashboard shows blank page
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify nginx.conf has SPA routing
- Check Flutter build completed successfully

### Issue: Routes not working (404)
- Verify nginx.conf has `try_files $uri $uri/ /index.html`
- Rebuild Docker container after nginx config changes

## üìù Notes

**After completing Phase 1:**
1. Update this checklist with completion date
2. Create a summary of any issues encountered
3. Move on to [NEXT_STEPS_ROADMAP.md](NEXT_STEPS_ROADMAP.md) Phase 2

**If you get stuck:**
1. Re-read the relevant section in NEXT_STEPS_ROADMAP.md
2. Check KNOWN_ISSUES.md for similar problems
3. Look at existing code for examples
4. Test incrementally (don't change everything at once)

---

**Good luck!** üöÄ

This phase should take approximately 2-3 hours to complete.
