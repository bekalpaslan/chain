# The Chain

> üö® **AI ASSISTANTS: Start here ‚Üí [CLAUDE_START_HERE.md](CLAUDE_START_HERE.md)** - Critical context and orchestrator system guide

> "Grow with solidarity and trust. A social experiment."

A viral social network where participants form a single, global chain by inviting one person each through time-limited QR code tickets.

## üîó Concept

The Chain is a minimalist social experience that combines social curiosity, viral dynamics, and collective accountability. A single chain connects everyone ‚Äî starting from one seed ‚Äî and every new participant must be attached through a one-time, time-limited invitation ticket.

## üéØ Core Mechanics

- Each user generates **one shareable QR code ticket**
- Tickets expire after **24 hours**
- Unused tickets return to sender and are logged as "wasted attempts"
- All attachments are **publicly visible**
- Users receive a unique **Chain Key** upon joining

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

- **Frontend**: Flutter (iOS, Android, Web/PWA)
- **Backend**: Java Spring Boot microservices
- **Database**: PostgreSQL + Redis
- **Real-time**: WebSocket for live updates

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Docker & Docker Compose
- Java 17+ (for backend development)
- Flutter SDK (for frontend development)

### Quick Start

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/ticketz.git
cd ticketz

# Start the backend services
docker-compose up -d

# Access the applications
# - Backend API: http://localhost:8080
# - Public App: http://localhost:3000
# - Private App: http://localhost:3001
```

### Authentication

The Chain supports **hybrid authentication** with two flexible login methods:

1. **Email/Password** - Traditional login with BCrypt password hashing + optional device registration
2. **Device Fingerprint** - Passwordless, zero-friction login using SHA-256 device fingerprinting

**Test with seed user (Email/Password):**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/v1/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "email": "alpaslan@alpaslan.com",
    "password": "alpaslan"
  }'
```

**Test with device fingerprint:**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/v1/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "deviceId": "web_489323232",
    "deviceFingerprint": "2d23d5f144c842a766b91e0853be834ea85143ff80ba5b6926ac64330a02bc2d"
  }'
```

See [Hybrid Authentication Documentation](docs/HYBRID_AUTHENTICATION_IMPLEMENTATION.md) for complete implementation details.

## üìä Success Metrics

- Daily new attachments
- Ticket usage rate before expiration
- Chain continuity duration
- Geographic spread
- Retention rates

## üë• Target Audience

Mobile-first users aged 16-40 who enjoy social experiments, gamification, and global participation.
