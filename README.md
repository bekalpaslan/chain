# The Chain

> "Keep the Chain Alive."

A viral social network where participants form a single, global chain by inviting one person each through time-limited QR code tickets.

## 🔗 Concept

The Chain is a minimalist social experience that combines social curiosity, viral dynamics, and collective accountability. A single chain connects everyone — starting from one seed — and every new participant must be attached through a one-time, time-limited invitation ticket.

## 🎯 Core Mechanics

- Each user generates **one shareable QR code ticket**
- Tickets expire after **24 hours**
- Unused tickets return to sender and are logged as "wasted attempts"
- All attachments are **publicly visible**
- Users receive a unique **Chain Key** upon joining

## 🏗️ Architecture

- **Frontend**: Flutter (iOS, Android, Web/PWA)
- **Backend**: Java Spring Boot microservices
- **Database**: PostgreSQL + Redis
- **Real-time**: WebSocket for live updates
