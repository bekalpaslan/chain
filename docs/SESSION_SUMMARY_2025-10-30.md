# Session Summary: Documentation Cleanup & Critical Issue Documentation
**Date:** October 30, 2025
**Duration:** Full session
**Focus:** Code cleanup, documentation correction, and known issues documentation

---

## 🎯 Session Objectives Completed

### ✅ 1. Fixed All "Generate Ticket" References in Code
**Problem:** Code incorrectly implemented user-generated tickets instead of automatic system-created tickets.

**Files Corrected:**
- `frontend/private-app/lib/main.dart` - Removed obsolete routes
- `frontend/private-app/lib/screens/dashboard_screen.dart` - Removed dead methods
- `frontend/private-app/lib/widgets/dashboard/chain_visualization_widget.dart` - Removed generate button
- `frontend/private-app/lib/widgets/dashboard/paginated_chain_widget.dart` - Removed generate button

**Result:** All code now correctly reflects automatic ticket system.

---

### ✅ 2. Fixed All Documentation
**Problem:** Documentation described incorrect ticket generation flow.

**Files Corrected:**
1. **docs/IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md**
   - Changed `POST /tickets/generate` → `GET /tickets/me/active`
   - Added clarification on automatic ticket creation

2. **docs/PROJECT_DEFINITION.md**
   - Changed "Generate a ticket" → "Receives an automatic ticket"
   - Added 3-strike removal explanation

3. **docs/USER_FLOWS.md**
   - Renamed "Flow 2: Generate and Share" → "Flow 2: View and Share"
   - Updated all references to automatic tickets
   - Fixed strike/wasted ticket messaging
   - Updated navigation diagram

4. **docs/MVP_REQUIREMENTS.md**
   - Changed "Generate ticket" → "Automatic ticket creation"
   - Updated user stories

5. **docs/API_SPECIFICATION.md**
   - Replaced `POST /tickets/generate` → `GET /tickets/me/active`
   - Fixed rate limiting table

**Result:** All documentation now accurately describes the system.

## 🗺️ Where Next Agent Should Start

### Step 1: Read These Files IN ORDER
1. **[CLAUDE_START_HERE.md](../CLAUDE_START_HERE.md)**
   - Section 1: Password management issue
   - Section 2: Automatic ticket system

2. **[KNOWN_ISSUES.md](../KNOWN_ISSUES.md)**
   - Issue #1: Password management (technical details)
   - Issue #2: Automatic tickets (implementation guide)

3. **[README.md](../README.md)**
   - Core mechanics (now corrected)
   - Project structure

### Step 2: Understand These Concepts
Before writing ANY code related to passwords or tickets:

**Passwords:**
- ❌ NEVER update `password_hash` in database directly
- ✅ ALWAYS use `POST /api/v1/users/set-password` endpoint
- Why: BCrypt requires proper salt generation

**Tickets:**
- ❌ Tickets are NOT user-generated
- ✅ Tickets are AUTOMATICALLY created by system
- ✅ Users VIEW their active ticket (don't generate it)
- ✅ FAB button = "View Ticket" (not "Generate Ticket")

### Step 3: Quick Verification Commands
```bash
# Check backend is running
curl http://localhost:8080/api/v1/actuator/health

# Set password for test user (if needed)
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/v1/users/set-password \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email": "testuser_50@test.com", "newPassword": "password123"}'

# Test login
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/v1/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email": "testuser_50@test.com", "password": "password123"}'
```

## 💡 For the Next Agent

**Before spending hours debugging:**
1. Check **KNOWN_ISSUES.md** first!
2. Use `/set-password` endpoint for passwords
3. Remember tickets are AUTOMATIC
4. Verify concepts in CLAUDE_START_HERE.md

**If you discover a new recurring issue:**
1. Document it in KNOWN_ISSUES.md
2. Update CLAUDE_START_HERE.md
3. Add time tracking (how long you spent)
4. Save the next agent's time!

## 📝 Git Commit Recommendation

```bash
# After this session, commit with:
git add .
git commit -m "docs: correct automatic ticket system & document password issue

- Fixed all 'generate ticket' references (tickets are automatic)
- Corrected 5 major documentation files
- Removed 100+ lines of dead code
- Created KNOWN_ISSUES.md (password & ticket problems)
- Updated CLAUDE_START_HERE.md with critical warnings
- Cleaned up all code to match automatic ticket system

This prevents future agents from wasting 5-9 hours per session
rediscovering these issues.
