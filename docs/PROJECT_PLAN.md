### **1. Executive Summary**

**Project Name:** *The Chain*
**Type:** Social Mobile Game / Viral Network
**Goal:** Create a global, self-propagating social experience where every participant is part of a single continuous chain, growing through invitation and accountability.

The Chain is both a minimalist social game and a global participation experiment. It combines time-based pressure, transparency, and virality to encourage collective effort and curiosity.

---

### **2. Problem Statement**

Traditional social networks are bloated, noisy, and lack a sense of shared purpose. Users are isolated in their own clusters, disconnected from a unified social experience.

**The Chain** addresses this by:

* Creating a single, linear chain connecting every participant.
* Turning social connection into a *collective challenge*.
* Using transparency and time limits to foster engagement and accountability.

---

### **3. Objectives**

1. **Design and launch** a mobile app where participants can join a growing chain.
2. **Implement a time-limited ticket system** that controls attachment flow and creates urgency.
3. **Build a transparent visualization** showing the global scale and real-time growth.
4. **Encourage viral propagation** through QR-based ticket sharing.
5. **Maintain anonymity and privacy** while supporting optional geo data.

---

### **4. Target Audience**

* **Age Range:** 16–40
* **Personas:**

  * *Social Explorers* who enjoy new social experiments
  * *Gamified Influencers* who like to see their impact
  * *Casual Users* curious about trends and global participation
* **Regions:** Global; designed to be language-light and emoji-friendly

### **8. Risk Management**

| Risk                                     | Mitigation                                                         |
| ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Low engagement after initial novelty** | Add global milestones, mini-events, and visual unlocks.            |
| **Privacy concerns (geo data)**          | Make location sharing fully optional and generalized.              |
| **Server overload from viral growth**    | Use scalable cloud infrastructure with load balancing.             |
| **QR abuse or fake tickets**             | Use cryptographically signed QR tickets tied to server validation. |
| **Chain stagnation**                     | Implement chain reactivation events and “chain revival” rewards.   |
