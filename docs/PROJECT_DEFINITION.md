### **1. Product Vision**

**Project Name:** *The Chain*
**Core Idea:** A single, global, ever-growing social chain where every participant is visibly connected to one another through a transparent, gamified attachment system.

**Tagline:** "Grow with solidarity and trust. A social experiment."

The Chain is a minimalist mobile experience that combines social curiosity, viral dynamics, and collective accountability. A single chain connects everyone — starting from one seed — and every new participant must be attached through a one-time, time-limited invitation ticket.

---

### **2. Concept Overview**

Each user:

1. **Receives an automatic ticket (QR code)** upon joining — shareable with one person.
2. **Must successfully invite one person** to the chain using that ticket to complete their obligation.

Tickets expire after **24 hours**. If unused, a new ticket is **automatically created** and counted as a *wasted attempt*. After **3 wasted tickets**, the user is removed from the chain.

Participants can view real-time stats about the chain’s size, growth, and global spread. Each participant receives a **unique Chain Key** — their immutable proof of being part of the chain.
