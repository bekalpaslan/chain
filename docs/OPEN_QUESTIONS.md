## 1. Product & Business Questions

### 1.1 Chain Bootstrap Problem üî¥ BLOCKER

**Question:** How do we start the chain? Who is the seed user?

**Options:**
1. **Project creator as seed** - Alpaslan becomes position #1
2. **Symbolic seed account** - "The Chain" official account, managed by team
3. **First public claimer** - Launch ticket publicly, first scan wins
4. **Multiple seeds** - Start multiple independent chains (changes concept fundamentally)

**Implications:**
- Seed user has special status (position #1)
- Seed's ticket must be successfully claimed to start growth
- If seed ticket expires, chain growth stalls

**Recommendation:** Option 2 (symbolic seed) - create official "The Seeder" account, share first ticket via social media launch campaign.

**Decision:** ‚è≥ Pending

---

### 1.2 What Happens If Chain Breaks? üî¥ BLOCKER

**Question:** If tickets keep expiring and no one successfully attaches, does the chain "die"?

**Scenario:**
- User #1000 generates ticket
- Ticket expires (wasted)
- User #1000 generates another ticket
- Ticket expires again
- Repeat...
- No position #1001 is ever created

**Options:**
1. **Accept chain breaks** - It's part of the game, chain ends when growth stops
2. **Admin intervention** - Manually create attachments during low-growth periods
3. **Backup tickets** - Allow users to generate multiple tickets if previous ones fail
4. **Chain resurrection events** - Special campaigns to revive stalled chains

**Implications:**
- Affects long-term viability
- May need game design tweaks (extend expiration? allow multiple tickets?)

**Recommendation:** Option 1 for MVP (accept reality), Option 4 for post-launch (events to boost engagement).

**Decision:** ‚è≥ Pending

---

### 1.3 Monetization Strategy üü° Important

**Question:** How will The Chain make money (if at all)?

**Options:**
1. **Free forever** - No monetization, passion project
2. **Freemium** - Basic free, premium features (custom QR designs, stats insights, ad-free)
3. **Ads** - Display ads in stats view or feed
4. **Tokenization** - NFT chain keys, blockchain integration (future)
5. **Sponsorships** - Brands sponsor chain milestones or events
6. **Data licensing** - Anonymized social graph data (ethical concerns)

**Implications:**
- Affects architecture (payment processing, subscription management)
- Affects user trust (ads may hurt UX)
- Affects legal (ToS, privacy policy)

**Recommendation:** Free for MVP, explore options 2 or 5 post-launch based on user feedback.

**Decision:** ‚è≥ Pending

---

### 1.4 Geographic Restrictions üü° Important

**Question:** Should we launch globally or start with specific regions?

**Considerations:**
- GDPR (EU) vs. CCPA (California) vs. other privacy laws
- App Store / Play Store compliance varies by country
- Language support (MVP is English-only)
- Time zones affect 24-hour expiration perception

**Options:**
1. **Global from day 1** - Available worldwide, English only
2. **Soft launch** - Start with US/UK/Australia (English-speaking), expand later
3. **Regional chains** - Separate chains per region (changes core concept)

**Recommendation:** Option 2 (soft launch) - limits legal complexity, easier to manage initial growth.

**Decision:** ‚è≥ Pending

---

### 1.5 Age Restrictions üü° Important

**Question:** What is the minimum age to join The Chain?

**Considerations:**
- COPPA (US): Under 13 requires parental consent
- GDPR (EU): 16+ in most countries for data processing consent
- App Store: Can set age rating

**Options:**
1. **13+** - Standard for most social apps (requires parental consent mechanism)
2. **16+** - Simpler legally (no parental consent needed in EU)
3. **18+** - Simplest, but limits audience

**Recommendation:** 16+ for MVP (avoids parental consent complexity).

**Decision:** ‚è≥ Pending

---

## 2. Technical Questions

### 2.1 QR Code Generation: Client or Server? üü° Important

**Question:** Should QR codes be generated client-side or server-side?

**Client-side (Flutter library):**
- ‚úÖ Faster (no API call)
- ‚úÖ Less server load
- ‚ùå QR style inconsistency across devices
- ‚ùå Harder to add branding later

**Server-side (API returns image URL):**
- ‚úÖ Consistent styling
- ‚úÖ Can add branding, analytics tracking
- ‚úÖ Can cache on CDN
- ‚ùå Extra API call
- ‚ùå Server storage for images

**Recommendation:** Server-side for MVP - ensures consistency, easier to iterate on design.

**Decision:** ‚è≥ Pending

---

### 2.2 WebSocket vs. Server-Sent Events (SSE) üü¢ Nice to know

**Question:** Use WebSocket or SSE for real-time updates?

**WebSocket:**
- ‚úÖ Bidirectional (can push and receive)
- ‚úÖ Lower latency
- ‚ùå More complex (connection management, reconnection)
- ‚ùå Harder to scale (stateful connections)

**SSE:**
- ‚úÖ Simpler (HTTP-based)
- ‚úÖ Auto-reconnect built-in
- ‚úÖ Works through proxies/firewalls better
- ‚ùå One-way only (server ‚Üí client)
- ‚ùå Limited browser support (but polyfills exist)

**Recommendation:** WebSocket for MVP (already planned in tech docs), SSE as fallback for web clients.

**Decision:** ‚è≥ Pending (likely WebSocket)

---

### 2.3 Database Partitioning Strategy üü¢ Nice to know

**Question:** When/how should we partition large tables?

**Candidates:**
- `events_log` - Could partition by date (monthly)
- `user_activity` - Could partition by date (monthly)
- `wasted_tickets` - Could partition by date (yearly)

**When to implement:**
- Only if tables exceed 10M rows
- Monitor query performance
- Not needed for MVP

**Recommendation:** Defer until Month 6 post-launch, monitor growth.

**Decision:** ‚è≥ Defer to operations team

---

### 2.4 Multi-Region Deployment üü¢ Nice to know

**Question:** Should we deploy in multiple regions for latency?

**Single-Region:**
- ‚úÖ Simpler ops
- ‚úÖ Lower cost
- ‚ùå Higher latency for distant users

**Multi-Region:**
- ‚úÖ Lower latency globally
- ‚úÖ Disaster recovery
- ‚ùå Complex (data replication, consistency)
- ‚ùå Higher cost

**Recommendation:** Single-region for MVP (US-East or EU-West), expand based on user distribution.

**Decision:** ‚è≥ Pending (likely single-region for MVP)

---

## 3. User Experience Questions

### 3.1 What Happens on Simultaneous Ticket Claims? üî¥ BLOCKER

**Question:** If two people scan the same ticket at the exact same time, who wins?

**Scenario:**
- Alice generates ticket
- Bob scans at 12:00:00.000
- Charlie scans at 12:00:00.050
- Both API requests arrive nearly simultaneously

**Technical Solution:**
- Database constraint ensures one-time use
- First transaction to commit wins
- Second transaction fails with error

**UX Question:** What does Charlie see?

**Options:**
1. **"Ticket already used"** - Honest but frustrating
2. **"This ticket expired"** - White lie to save face
3. **"Unable to join, please try again"** - Vague
4. **Retry with exponential backoff** - App automatically retries (bad: Charlie still fails)

**Recommendation:** Option 1 (honest error) - shows transparency, explains failure clearly.

**Decision:** ‚è≥ Pending

---

### 3.2 Display Name Uniqueness üü° Important

**Question:** Can multiple users have the same display name?

**Options:**
1. **Allow duplicates** - "Alice" can exist multiple times (disambiguate by chain key or position)
2. **Enforce uniqueness** - First "Alice" claims the name, others must choose different
3. **Auto-disambiguate** - "Alice", "Alice #2", "Alice #3"

**Implications:**
- Option 1: Simplest, but confusing in chain tree view
- Option 2: Frustrating for users, limits choices
- Option 3: Ugly but functional

**Recommendation:** Option 1 for MVP (allow duplicates, show position or chain key for disambiguation).

**Decision:** ‚è≥ Pending

---

### 3.3 Anonymous User Numbering üü¢ Nice to know

**Question:** What number should anonymous users show?

**Options:**
1. **Chain position** - "Anonymous #42" (matches position in chain)
2. **Random number** - "Anonymous #8271" (privacy, but meaningless)
3. **Sequential anonymous counter** - "Anonymous #1", "Anonymous #2" (separate from position)

**Recommendation:** Option 1 (chain position) - simpler, meaningful, reduces cognitive load.

**Decision:** ‚è≥ Pending (likely option 1)

---

### 3.4 Ticket Sharing UX üü° Important

**Question:** What's the primary sharing method for tickets?

**Options:**
1. **Show QR, assume in-person scan** - Minimalist, forces face-to-face
2. **Share button (deep link via SMS/WhatsApp)** - More viral, works remotely
3. **Both** - Flexibility

**Implications:**
- In-person only: Slower growth but more intentional connections
- Remote sharing: Faster growth but less personal

**Recommendation:** Option 3 (both) - QR for in-person, share button for remote, users choose.

**Decision:** ‚è≥ Pending (likely option 3)

---

### 3.5 Onboarding Tutorial Length üü¢ Nice to know

**Question:** How many steps in the first-time user tutorial?

**Options:**
1. **No tutorial** - Intuitive design, learn by doing
2. **3-step overlay** - Highlight key actions (generate ticket, view stats, profile)
3. **Full walkthrough** - 5+ screens explaining concept

**Recommendation:** Option 2 (3-step overlay) - balances education with minimalism.

**Decision:** ‚è≥ Pending

---

## 4. Security & Privacy Questions

### 4.1 Device Fingerprint Stability üü° Important

**Question:** What happens when a user's device fingerprint changes?

**Scenarios:**
- User updates OS (iOS 17 ‚Üí iOS 18)
- User clears browser data (web)
- User gets new phone

**Current Design:**
- Device fingerprint used for login
- Fingerprint change = locked out

**Options:**
1. **Manual support recovery** - User contacts support with proof of identity
2. **Backup recovery method** - Email/phone verification (requires collecting email/phone)
3. **Graceful fingerprint update** - Allow fingerprint to drift slightly over time

**Recommendation:** Option 1 for MVP (manual support), consider Option 2 post-MVP.

**Decision:** ‚è≥ Pending

---

### 4.2 IP Logging Duration üü¢ Nice to know

**Question:** How long should we retain IP addresses in logs?

**Considerations:**
- GDPR: Personal data, minimize retention
- Security: Useful for abuse detection
- Storage: Logs can grow large

**Options:**
1. **7 days** - Minimal, only for immediate abuse detection
2. **30 days** - Standard practice for many services
3. **90 days** - Longer investigation window

**Recommendation:** 30 days for MVP (balance between security and privacy).

**Decision:** ‚è≥ Pending

---

### 4.3 Data Breach Notification üü° Important

**Question:** What is our data breach response plan?

**Legal Requirements:**
